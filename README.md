# ADVEYRA AI STUDIO — Gemini Edition (Updated)

Private browser-based AI coding workspace built with Node.js, Express and Google Gemini.

## Included

- Admin login with bcrypt password hash and signed session cookie.
- Gemini chat agent with tools to list, read, create and update workspace files.
- File tree, text editor, create/rename/delete file, create folder and refresh.
- Upload an individual file and import/extract a ZIP project into the workspace.
- Automatic backups before replacing or deleting existing text files and before ZIP import overwrites.
- Static HTML preview served from the workspace, with relative CSS/JS/assets and no-cache headers.
- Preview loads the latest saved editor contents; refresh reloads the selected file from disk.
- Export the workspace as ZIP.
- Optional GitHub push using a server-side GitHub token.
- Diagnostics and Render deployment configuration.

## Render deployment

- Runtime: Node
- Build command: `npm install`
- Start command: `npm start`
- Root directory: blank (repository root)

### Required Render environment variables

- `ADMIN_USERNAME`
- `ADMIN_PASSWORD_HASH` — bcrypt hash, not the plain password
- `SESSION_SECRET` — random secret of at least 32 characters
- `GEMINI_API_KEY` — Google AI Studio API key
- `GEMINI_MODEL` — default `gemini-3.1-flash-lite`

### Optional GitHub push variables

The service's Render GitHub connection (used for deploying the service) does not automatically authorize the application's **Push to GitHub** button. The button uses the GitHub REST API and requires all four variables below:

- `GITHUB_TOKEN` — fine-grained personal access token with access to the target repository and **Contents: Read and write** permission
- `GITHUB_OWNER` — GitHub username or organization that owns the target repository
- `GITHUB_REPO` — exact repository name
- `GITHUB_BRANCH` — target branch, normally `main`

Add these under Render → your Web Service → Environment. Never put the token in source code, the ZIP, browser JavaScript, or chat. After adding/updating environment variables, save and redeploy. Then run Diagnostics; GitHub integration should show the configured owner/repository.

## Using file import and editing

- **Upload file** uploads one file (up to 2 MB) into a relative workspace path.
- **Import ZIP** extracts a project archive into the workspace (up to 25 MB upload, 100 MB expanded content, 500 files).
- Existing files with matching paths are backed up before being replaced.
- `.env`, `.git`, `node_modules`, and `.adveyra-*` content is intentionally excluded from ZIP imports to avoid importing secrets or bulky dependency folders.
- Select a text file to view/edit it; click **Save file** to write changes.

## Preview limits

The Preview supports static HTML projects and workspace-relative CSS, JavaScript, images and other static assets. It is not a full Node/React/Vite/Next.js build runtime and does not start backend servers or run arbitrary terminal commands. For a framework app, build it in an appropriate runtime/hosting workflow and preview its generated static output (for example `dist/index.html`) where possible.

## Important hosting note

Render's free web-service filesystem is ephemeral. Workspace files may be lost when the service is restarted, redeployed or moved to another instance. Use **Export ZIP** and **Push to GitHub** regularly, or attach persistent storage if your hosting plan supports it. GitHub push does not delete unrelated files already present in the repository; it adds/updates files from the workspace.

## Security

- Keep all secrets in Render environment variables.
- Do not upload `.env` files or secrets into the workspace.
- Use a GitHub token limited to the target repository.
- Rotate any credentials that have been exposed in screenshots or shared chats.
